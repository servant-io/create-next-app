# Getting Started

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

This **Getting Started** section will help you create your first Next.js app and learn the core features you'll use in every project.

## Pre-requisite knowledge

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

- HTML

If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our [React Foundations course](/learn/react-foundations), and the [Next.js Foundations course](/learn/dashboard-app) that has you building an application as you learn.
